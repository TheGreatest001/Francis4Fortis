    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>Hey Fortris crew! I’m Francis—a guy who’s obsessed with crypto, loves helping people, and can’t wait to jump into your world in Málaga. I’m not some blockchain wizard (yet!), but I’m a fast learner with a big heart for tech and a knack for making things work. I saw your open application and thought, “This is it, my chance to join a team that’s changing how businesses use digital assets!” So here’s a peek at what I’ve done and why I’m so pumped to join you.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Stuff I’m Good At</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Techy Bits:</b> I mess around with HTML and PHP, and I’m good with Excel.</li>
      <li><b>Making People Happy:</b> Hit top 10% for customer satisfaction at Safaricom.</li>
      <li><b>Figuring Things Out:</b> Kept data clean and spot-on for AI and text projects.</li>
      <li><b>Learning on the Fly:</b> New tools? Bring it on, I’ll get the hang of it quick.</li>
      <li><b>Chatting:</b> English and Kiswahili are my thing. Great for talking to all kinds of folks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Story So Far (With a Crypto Twist!)</h2>
    <p>Here’s what I’ve been up to, and how I think it fits with what you’re doing at Fortris. I’ve sprinkled in some crypto daydreams to show I’m already in the game!</p>

    <h3>1. Rocking Sales at Safaricom (2023)</h3>
    <p><b>What Happened:</b> I was a Sales Agent and totally crushed it—beat my targets by 20% every month, landed in the top 10% for happy customers, and bumped sales up 15% by figuring out what people really wanted.</p>
    <p><b>Why It’s Fortris Material:</b> You’ve got enterprise clients who need to trust digital assets, right? I’m the guy who can explain stuff, solve problems, and keep them smiling—imagine me helping a client get comfy with a crypto wallet!</p>
    <p class="crypto-dream"><b>Crypto Dream:</b> I’ve been picturing myself selling blockchain solutions, telling a customer, “Hey, this is secure, easy, and the future!” I’d love to make that real with you.</p>

    <h3>2. Keeping Data Clean at Tech Solutions (2023)</h3>
    <p><b>What Happened:</b> As a Data Quality Analyst, I made sure AI data was perfect—no mess-ups, no headaches.</p>
    <p><b>Why It’s Fortris Material:</b> Digital assets need to be rock-solid—think accurate transactions or spotting a glitch in a payment. I’ve got the eagle eyes and patience for that.</p>
    <p class="crypto-dream"><b>Crypto Dream:</b> I made a little fake “crypto transaction log” once—caught a pretend double-spend just for fun. I’d kill to do that for real with your tools!</p>

    <h3>3. Digging Into Text at Kenya Data Services (2023-2024)</h3>
    <p><b>What Happened:</b> I analyzed text—figuring out feelings and patterns—and rallied a small team to get it done on time.</p>
    <p><b>Why It’s Fortris Material:</b> Maybe your clients want to know how people feel about crypto, or you need someone to crunch data fast. I’m your guy—teamwork and deadlines don’t scare me.</p>
    <p class="crypto-dream"><b>Crypto Dream:</b> I’ve been reading Bitcoin’s whitepaper (mind-blowing stuff!) and jotting down notes about privacy and trust. I’d love to use that curiosity to help you build something cool.</p>

    <h3>4. My DIY Crypto Adventure (2024)</h3>
    <p><b>What Happened:</b> I built a little HTML page called “Francis’s Crypto Corner”—it’s got links to stuff I’ve read (like Ethereum’s big switch), terms I’ve learned (what’s a “nonce” anyway?), and a fake transaction log I played with.</p>
    <p><b>Why It’s Fortris Material:</b> It’s me showing I’m not just talking the talk—I’m walking it too. I’m already diving into crypto because I can’t get enough of it!</p>
    <p><b>Sneak Peek:</b></p>
    <code>
      &lt;h1&gt;Francis’s Crypto Corner&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
      &lt;p&gt;Cool Fact: Miners use a “nonce” to crack blocks—wild, right?&lt;/p&gt;<br>
      &lt;p&gt;Fake Log: “Sent 0.05 BTC—oops, flagged it, looks fishy!”&lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
    <p>(I’d stick a screenshot in here if I could—imagine it’s scribbly and full of excitement!)</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why I’m Losing It Over Fortris</h2>
    <p>You’re making digital assets simple and safe for businesses—that’s huge, and I want in! I can picture myself starting with client support or data stuff, soaking up everything about blockchain, and growing into someone who helps shape the future with you. Málaga’s calling my name too—I’m ready to pack my bags, soak up the sun, and join your vibe. Flexible hours, a killer team, and unlimited coffee? I’m already sold (coffee’s my fuel, no joke).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Let’s Make It Happen</h2>
    <p><b>My Resume:</b> Attached—dig into the nitty-gritty of my journey.</p>
    <p><b>Say Hi:</b> Call me at +254(0)746530043 or email <a href="mailto:francismuchiri027@gmail.com">francismuchiri027@gmail.com</a>. I’m dying to talk about how I can help Fortris rock the crypto world!</p>
